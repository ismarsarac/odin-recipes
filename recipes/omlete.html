    <p>Simple omlete using oilive oil instead of butter, and cooking eggs quickly in a hot pan. </p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>3 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon crmbled goat cheese</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons chopped chives</li>
        <li>sea salt and grond black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat, swirling oil to coat the skillet. Pour beaten eggs into the hot skillet and cook in hot oil until eggs bubble and begin to firm up.</li>
        <li>Lift the cooked edges of omelet with a rubber spatula and tilt the skillet so any uncooked egg runs underneath the lifted edge. Continue cooking, lifting the edges and tilting the skillet, until omelet is almost completely set, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove the skillet from heat. Spread any runny egg evenly over the top of omelet using the spatula.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle goat cheese, 1 1/2 teaspoons chives, sea salt, and black pepper over omelet. Gently lift one edge and fold 1/3 of the omelet into the center over cheese and chives. Fold the opposite 1/3 of the omelet into the center. Slide omelet to the edge of the skillet and flip, folded-side down, onto a plate.</li>
    </ol>
